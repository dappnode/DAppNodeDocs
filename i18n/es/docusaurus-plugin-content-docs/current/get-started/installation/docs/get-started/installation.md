# Introduction

Now you know what is DAppNode and want to know how you can engage with DAppNode. Firstly, you need to run DAppNode in a dedicated machine, that means you should use a machine only for dappnode.

DAppNode users have to understand that every package is unique and has its own requirements. Some packages need more disk space or use more the RAM than others.

As we said before, DAppNode is a open source project. You can see the source code and install it in your own machine. Where and how to run DAppNode?
