# Wizard Reference

The setup wizard for DAppNode packages helps automate the package customization and improve its user experience. You can allow users to conveniently edit environment variables, port mappings, and upload files while interacting with a simple web form, right before installing the package.

## How to use

To add this functionality, create a file `setup-wizard.yml` in the root of your DAppNode package directory. Both JSON and YAML formats are supported, but YAML makes writing markdown text blocks much easier (its used in the [`description`](#description) property).

```diff
  DAppNodePackage-my-package.public.dappnode.eth/
  ├── build
  │   ├── ...
  │   └── Dockerfile
  ├── avatar-my-package.png
  ├── dappnode_package.json
  ├── docker-compose.yml
+ └── setup-wizard.yml
```

## Example

```yaml
version: "2"
fields:
  - id: payoutAddress,
    target:
      type: environment
      name: PAYOUT_ADDRESS
      service: service1
    title: Payout address
    description: >-
      Address to send **payouts** too. [More info](https://more.info)
      Supports markdown and multiline
    secret: true
    pattern: "^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$"
    patternErrorMessage: Must be a valid address (0x1fd16a...)
    enum:
      - normal
      - archive
      - advanced
    required: true
    if: { "mode": { "enum": ["advanced"] } }
```

### id

Unique property ID required for internal form parsing, and to use the `if` conditional block.

- is **required**
- type: `string`

Example:

```yaml
id: payoutAddress
```

### target

Maps the setup wizard field to a package configuration option. Supports:

- [`environment`](#environment): For environment variables
- [`portMapping`](#portMapping): For port mapping
- [`namedVolumeMountpoint`](#namedVolumeMountpoint): To allow hosting a specific package volume into a different drive or mountpoint
- [`allNamedVolumesMountpoint`](#allNamedVolumesMountpoint): To allow hosting all package volumes into a different drive or mountpoint
- [`fileUpload`](#fileUpload): To upload user files to the package container

#### environment

To customize environment variables with user input. Targeted variables must be declared in the package's docker-compose. You can customize the type of input shown in the UI with this field properties

- [`secret`](#secret): Hides input, to collect sensitive data.
- [`pattern`](#pattern): To validate input against any Regex expression.
- [`enum`](#enum): Show as a select dropdown menu.

It exists two ways of defining environment variables. The first one, where you define one environment var for one service, you the format to do it is the following:

```yaml
target:
  type: environment
  name: PAYOUT_ADDRESS
  service: service1
```

In case you want to define an environment variable that is used in multiple services you can define it in the next way:

```yaml
target:
  type: environment
  name: PAYOUT_ADDRESS
  service: [service1, service2, service2]
```

##### name

The name of the environment variable as declared in the docker-compose.

- is **required**
- type: `string`

Example:

```yaml
name: PAYOUT_ADDRESS
```

##### service

In multi-service package, which service should be targeted with this setting.

- type: `string`

Examples:

```yaml
service: service1
```

#### portMapping

To customize port mappings with user input. Targeted container port must be declared in the package's docker-compose.

```yaml
target:
  type: portMapping
  containerPort: 9554/UDP
  service: service1
```

##### containerPort

Exposed container port to map to. Must follow the format `{portNumber}` or `{portNumber}/{PROTOCOL}`, where PROTOCOL must be `TCP` or `UDP` in all caps.

- is **required**
- type: `string`

Examples:

```yaml
containerPort: 9554
```

```yaml
containerPort: 9554/TCP
```

##### service

#### namedVolumeMountpoint

```yaml
target:
  type: namedVolumeMountpoint
  volumeName: blockchain_data
```

##### volumeName

- is **required**
- type: `string`

Example:

```yaml
volumeName: blockchain_data
```

#### allNamedVolumesMountpoint

To allow hosting all package volumes into a different drive or mountpoint at once. Use this option if your package has multiple heavy volumes whose mountpoint should be changed at once.

```yaml
target:
  type: allNamedVolumesMountpoint
```

#### fileUpload

To allow hosting a specific package volume into a different drive or mountpoint

```yaml
target:
