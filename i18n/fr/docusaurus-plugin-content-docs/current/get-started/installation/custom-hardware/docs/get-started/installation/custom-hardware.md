DAppNode must be installed in a dedicated machine. Although, the requirements you need depends in part on what you run in your DAppNode. We will recommend some minimum requirements:

- 8 GB RAM
- SSD hard drive, 1 TB at least.
- Wired connection.
- Screen and keyboard (Only for the first installation)

> :information_source: Requirements vary greatly for each usecase. Blockchain sizes change quickly, specs may be out of date.
