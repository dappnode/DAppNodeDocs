### How to report an issue properly?

An issue can be opened for requesting features or reporting errors mainly. We recommend opening an issue in our Github repository. It's so important you select the repository correctly. If there is a bug in the documentation or you would like some content is here you should do it in the [DAppNodeDocs repository](https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNodeDocs/issues/new/choose). But if the issue is related to the application you should open an issue on the [DAppMannager repository](https://github.com/dappnode/DNP_DAPPMANAGER/issues/new/choose).
