# Help to translate

As you can see we have added 2 more languages to the documentation, if you want to help us with the translation process, now you can do it using the platform crowdin for it.

## Crowdin Platform

If you want to collaborate with the translation of the documentation, you only need an account in [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), look for the project DAppNodeDocs. You will see the two languages we have enabled to add translations for now: Spanish and French. You have to select some of the files of the documentation and translate them.
