Always point the airstream somewhere other than your device when starting to use it, as these release liquid for a brief period of time sometimes. After you've made sure the duster is working as expected, start blowing at the smaller spaces in the board and gradually moving to the more general area of your hardware without getting the tip of the duster to close to the circuits.
