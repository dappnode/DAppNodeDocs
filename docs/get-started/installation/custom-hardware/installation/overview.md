# Overview

DAppNode project is open source which means you can install it on your hardware. There are two main ways to install DAppNode:

- [Installing with a script](./script.md)
- [Installing with an ISO](./iso.md)

There are some little differences that we have to mention. These differences are details and it does not affect the user experience.

If you install DAppNode with an ISO, you will have 2 core packages installed by default:

- Wireguard
- Https

Wireguard is a VPN client and HTTPS is a feature that lets you securely expose your endpoint to the public.

If you install DAppNode using the script, these packages are not currently included and you can install them on your own. For the next release these packages will be installed automatically.
