2. The first thing you need to set up is the type of client you want to use. We recommend this set-up:
   - Full Node
   - Turn on the Use remote during syncing or errors
   - The client, we don't have a preference between geth, nethermind ...

This configuration can be modified whatever you want. You can find all the information with all the details about this decision in [this section](https://docs.dappnode.io/first-steps).

3. The next window are asking you about the System Auto Updates. If you turn on this option, your DAppNode will be updated automatically when it detects there is a new version enabled. 24 hours after DAppNode releases there is a new version, it will start the installation of the new version.
   From DAppNode we recommend to turn on this option.
