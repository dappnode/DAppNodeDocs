## Minimum requirements

You will need a dedicated machine to install it.

Ethereum is big! To cope with that, you’ll need to have a powerful enough machine to keep up with Ethereum’s rapidly splitting blocks.

That is why we recommend having at least 8gbs RAM and a SSD hard drive with at least 160 GBs (add capacity as you like, keep in mind that Ethereum is 130GBs at press time).

## How to install Dappnode on your machine

Okay, so you’re ready to join the real DAppers. Let us show you how to make that hardware sing the hardware decentralization song!

### How to install DAppNode from an ISO

Download the image from `DAppNode-ubuntu-18.04-server-amd64_v0.1.16.iso <https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNode/releases/download/v0.1.16/DAppNode-ubuntu-18.04-server-amd64_v0.1.16.iso>`_ or `build it from source <https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNode_Installer>`_

### Burn the ISO in a USB (~8 min)

Burn the ISO to an USB stick, please follow the official Ubuntu instructions for `MacOS <https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#0>`_, `Windows <https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#0>`_ or `Ubuntu <https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#0>`\_.

Please note that these instructions are intended to generate the ISO image in a bootable USB from a Mac, Windows or Linux device , and then install it in a server. **_IF YOU EXECUTE THE BOOTABLE USB IN A MACHINE CONTAINING DATA IT WILL BE ERASED._** DAppnode is intended to run 24/7 so if you install it in a laptop or desktop machine and you turn it off it will lose the sync

### Install an Ubuntu distribution (~15 min)

Insert the USB into your Server and prepare to install an Ubuntu distribution. You will have to make sure that your Server boots from the USB. If you succeed at booting up from your USB, you will be greeted with this screen or a similar one:

Follow the Ubuntu installation steps; various screens will guide you through the process. You can follow this standard option for a default installation:

## Installation via script

### WARNING

This software is not meant to be run in a remote machine hosted by any remote provider. What DAppNode specifically wants to avoid is centralization of the machines that our digital lives rely on; nevertheless we understand that before buying a dedicated machine to run your Dappnode you might want to test it and see how easy it is to use….

And… only for that reason will we look aside when someone installs a DAppNode in a virtual provider. We want it to be clear that kind of use is not the recommended use, but for testing purposes only.

Remember: **_Your hardware, your coins, your privacy, your freedom._**

### Script installation guide

For this example we'll be installing DAppNode on a Digital Ocean droplet, but the process should work for any other Ubuntu Server 18.04.

**_We strongly recommend using 8GB+ of RAM and a 160Gb+ SSD hard drive._**

### Install DAppNode and its dependencies

Install the prerequisites (docker and docker-compose) running this command in the terminal of the machine you want to install the DAppNode server,if using a Virtual Service Provider, you have first to connect you via SSH to that machine.

```
sudo wget -O - https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNode/releases/download/v0.1.16/dappnode_install_pre.sh | sudo bash
```

### Install DAppNode

```
sudo wget -O - https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNode/releases/download/v0.1.16/dappnode_install.sh | sudo bash
```

If you have an static IP and want to set it up right from the connection, then run the command with the following variable including your static ip

```
sudo wget -O - https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNode/releases/download/v0.1.16/dappnode_install.sh | sudo STATIC_IP="your static IP" bash
```

When the installation is done and is successful, you will be given credentials to connect to your DAppNode.

Take into account that the chain will take some time to synchronize and you will not be able to perform most of the actions before that.


### How to restore an installed DAppNode to the latest version:

If you are experiencing any problem or just want  to make  sure you are running  the latest DAppNode versions,execute this command in the DAppNode terminal. This will update the core packages to the latest versions without erasing any data from your volumes. 

```
sudo wget -O - https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNode/releases/download/v0.1.16/dappnode_install.sh | sudo UPDATE=true bash
```
