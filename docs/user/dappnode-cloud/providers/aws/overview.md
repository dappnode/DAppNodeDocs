# AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers a wide range of services, including computing power, storage options, and networking capabilities, enabling users to build and deploy applications and services efficiently.

## Dappnode AWS AMI

The Dappnode AMI is an image specifically designed for running Dappnode in the AWS environment. It contains all the pre-installed software and configurations required to deploy a fully functional Dappnode instance. By using the Dappnode AMI, users can quickly launch an instance in the cloud without having to manually set up and configure the Dappnode software, simplifying the deployment process and ensuring consistency across different instances.

#### Dappnode AMI ðŸ“€

The Dappnode AMI is available for $15 per month. This fee grants you access to the Dappnode image, allowing you to launch as many instances as you need. This cost covers the use of Dappnode's software in the cloud.

#### AWS Machines ðŸ–¥

In addition to the Dappnode AMI fee, you will incur charges for the AWS infrastructure itself. These costs vary based on several factors:

- **Instance Type:** The specifications of the machine you choose, such as CPU and memory will affect the pricing.

- **Storage:** The amount and type of storage you select for your instance, will also influence the cost.

- **Region:** AWS pricing varies by region, so the location where you launch your instance can impact the overall cost.

AWS operates on a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you only pay for the resources you use. Before launching your instance, you can view an estimate of the expected costs on the Dappnode AMI launch page. This estimate provides transparency, helping you plan your budget effectively.
