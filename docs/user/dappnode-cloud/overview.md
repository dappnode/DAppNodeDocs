## Why using Dappnode Cloud?

Dappnode Cloud offers numerous advantages over traditional hardware-based setups. By leveraging cloud infrastructure, you can bypass the complexities and limitations associated with physical hardware. Here are the key benefits that make Dappnode Cloud an attractive option:

### No Initial Hardware Investment 💰

With Dappnode Cloud, there is no need to invest in expensive physical servers or other hardware components. This significantly reduces the initial cost barrier, allowing you to allocate resources towards development and innovation rather than infrastructure.

### Maintenance-Free 🧑‍🔧️

Managing physical hardware can be time-consuming and requires a certain level of expertise. Dappnode Cloud eliminates the need for hardware maintenance, as cloud providers handle all aspects of hardware management. This ensures your Dappnode runs smoothly without any interruptions.

### Scalability 📈

One of the standout benefits of using cloud infrastructure is its scalability. With Dappnode Cloud, you can easily scale your resources up or down based on your current needs. Whether you're experiencing a lack of storage you can adjust your cloud resources accordingly without the constraints of physical hardware limitations.

### Global Accessibility 🌐

Dappnode Cloud provides the flexibility to access and manage your dappnode instance from anywhere in the world, as long as you have an internet connection. This global accessibility ensures that you are not bound to a single location and can manage your machine status remotely, starting or rebooting it whenever you desire.

## Use cases

Dappnode Cloud offers versatile solutions for various users, providing the flexibility and reliability needed to meet your goals. Here are some of the primary use cases:

### Blockchain participation & Solo Staking ⛓️

If obtaining hardware is not an option, Dappnode Cloud allows you to run a full node or even host your Ethereum or Gnosis validators without worrying about hardware requirements, internet connectivity, or power outages. This ensures continuous participation in the blockchain network with minimal hassle.

### Testing 🧪

For those considering purchasing their own Dappnode but still uncertain, Dappnode Cloud provides an excellent opportunity to run a temporary Dappnode. This allows you to demo the system without facing the initial cost barrier, helping you make an informed decision.

### Developing 🧑‍💻️

Dappnode Cloud is an excellent choice for developers who need a reliable and scalable environment to test and deploy dApps. Without the constraints of local hardware, developers can quickly iterate and deploy their applications, leveraging the power of cloud computing to simulate real-world conditions.
