# What is Dappnode Cloud?

Dappnode Cloud is a service that allows users to deploy a Dappnode in a cloud provider so it can be tested without the need for physical hardware. We provide easy pre-configured instances for the main cloud providers (AWS for now, more to come later) to continue to make the deployment of web3 infrastructrure accessible and hassle-free for everyone. It consists of a Dappnode image deployed on a machine instance from a cloud provider, eliminating the need to invest in hardware in order to test Dappnode.

This allows you to run your decentralized applications more efficiently and cost-effectively, as you can customize your hardware specifications to meet your needs.

## Why using Dappnode Cloud?

Dappnode Cloud offers numerous advantages over traditional hardware-based setups. By leveraging cloud infrastructure, you can bypass the complexities and limitations associated with physical hardware. Here are the key benefits that make Dappnode Cloud an attractive option:

### No Initial Hardware Investment üí∞

With Dappnode Cloud, there is no need to purchase an entire new machine every time you need a new Dappnode. This significantly reduces the initial cost barrier, allowing you to test Dappnode before you decide to install it in a physical machine or to quickly deploy a new Dappnode without having to purchase a new machine.

### Stop when you want üßë‚ÄçüîßÔ∏è

For short stints, Dappnode Cloud allows you to deploy and also to stop running your Dappnode as soon as you have performed the tasks you wanted to do, with no electronic waste or an unallocated physical machine on your side.

### Scalability üìà

With Dappnode Cloud, you can easily scale your resources up or down based on your current needs. Whether you're experiencing a lack of storage or you need a few more nodes quickly, you can adjust your cloud resources accordingly without the constraints of physical hardware limitations.

## Physical or Cloud?

It is much better to run a physical Dappnode at your place for these 2 main reasons:

### 1. Economics üí≤

A physical machine has a higher initial cost, but leverages your existing internet connection and consumes less energy than your fridge. This initial cost is pretty much the only cost you will have for the lifetime of the hardware you use.
Cloud servers have monthly costs associated with it that never go away, resulting in higher cost in the long term.

In summary, you will be better off with a physical machine if you plan to use your Dappnode for a long time, and better off with a Dappnode Cloud if you only want to use the instance for a short period of time.

### 2. Decentralization üóΩ

The networks you will run on your Dapppnode become more resilient to corporate capture, government interference and localized events the more decentralized their nodes are. By running a Node in the cloud it is very likely that there is already a node of that network in the same data center, therefore adding no extra value to the decentralization of the network.
If instead you run the same node in a home setup from your home, you are adding a node that is much harder to censor, block, locate and subjugate than a node controlled by a big infrastructure corporation.

Remember, "The Cloud" is just someone else's computer.

## Use cases

Dappnode Cloud offers versatile solutions for various users, providing the flexibility and reliability needed to meet your goals. Here are some of the primary use cases:

### Blockchain participation & Solo Staking ‚õìÔ∏è

If obtaining hardware is not an option, Dappnode Cloud allows you to run a full node or even host your Ethereum or Gnosis validators without worrying about hardware requirements, internet connectivity, or power outages. This ensures continuous participation in the blockchain network with minimal hassle.

### Testing üß™

For those considering purchasing their own Dappnode but still uncertain, Dappnode Cloud provides an excellent opportunity to run a temporary Dappnode. This allows you to demo the system without facing the initial cost barrier, helping you make an informed decision.

### Developing üßë‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è

Dappnode Cloud is an excellent choice for developers who need a reliable and scalable environment to test and deploy dApps. Without the constraints of local hardware, developers can quickly iterate and deploy their applications, leveraging the power of cloud computing to simulate real-world conditions.
