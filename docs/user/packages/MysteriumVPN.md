# MysteriumVPN
Mysterium will let you earn passive income by making your bandwidth available through a VPN.

### Disclaimer
This package allows you to share your bandwidth with other users of the Mysterium network. Depending on your country, there might be laws restricting the websites you can visit. Kindly keep in mind that Dappnode is not responsible for any internet activity happening through your bandwidth via this package. Mysterium offers an option for accepting only whitelisted traffic. Please read their FAQ to know more about Mysterium's network encryption, whitelisting policy and exit node guidance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before installing the MysteriumVPN package on your Dappnode, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- A running Dappnode installation with internet access.
- Sufficient storage and bandwidth capacity to share with the Mysterium Network. Please pay special attention to any requirements both your ISP and local jurisdiction might have that would affect your node.

### Installation

1. **Access Dappnode Dashboard:** Log into your Dappnode's administrative interface through your web browser. This can usually be done via `http://my.dappnode`. After you're in, go to the DAppStore in the left menu bar.

3. **Install Package:** Click on the "Install" button next to the MysteriumVPN package. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

### Configuration

After installing the Mysterium package, you'll need to configure it to start sharing your bandwidth:

1. **Open Mysterium Dashboard:** Navigate to the "Packages" section in the Dappnode Dashboard, find Mysterium and click on "Mysterium UI" to access the package's dashboard.

2. **Configure Bandwidth Sharing:** Follow the setup wizard's instructions. You'll be asked to fund your node with a small amount of the $MYST token in this step. Once you're inside the main dashboard, you can configure the amount of bandwidth you wish to share, set up whitelisting options, and adjust other settings according to your preferences.

3. **Start Sharing your Mysterium node!:** Once configured, your Dappnode will begin sharing bandwidth with the Mysterium Network and paying you $MYST fees through the Polygon network.

To monitor your earnings and manage your $MYST tokens, refer to the Mysterium dashboard inside the UI.
