# Info

The Info section provides a comprehensive overview of the package's status and essential details. This section is crucial for understanding the current state of the package and managing its basic operations. Below are the key features you'll find in the Info section:

- **Version**: Displays both the package's version and its upstream version.
- **Getting Started**: Provides essential information needed to run the package. You can remove this section if it's not needed anymore.
- **Links**: Offers various options, including bundled package UI/Dashboards, related tools such as Launchpads, and external documentation.
- **Package Status Indicator**: Indicates the current status of the package (e.g., running, crashed, restarting).
- **Package Status Manager**: Allows you to play/pause or restart the package for management and troubleshooting purposes.
- **Remove Volumes**: Wipes all package data. For blockchain nodes/clients, this will force the package to start syncing from scratch (or from a checkpoint if a proper URL has been set). This option is represented by a gray trash bin icon.
- **Remove Package**: Completely removes the package from your Dappnode. You can choose to either keep or delete any data associated with it. This option is represented by a red trash bin icon.
