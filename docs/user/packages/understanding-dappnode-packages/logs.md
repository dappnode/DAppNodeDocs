# Logs

This is a great section for finding out something that is not working in your package or to look for both expected and unexpected behavior. Packages with multiple services will give you the option to switch logs in the top "Service" bar, something common for consensus clients for example, which usually run one service for the `beacon-chain` and another one for `validator`. Whenever you request for support in the Dappnode community, keep these handy!
