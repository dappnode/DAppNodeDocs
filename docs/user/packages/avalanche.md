By running an Avalanche node on Dappnode, you actively participate in the decentralization of the network. Through this engagement, you contribute to the security and reliability of Avalanche’s consensus model.

Engage in AVAX staking to contribute to the security and decentralization of the Avalanche network. Stake your AVAX tokens to become a delegator or validator, and in return, earn rewards for your participation in the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. With a minimum of 2000 AVAX tokens required to start a validator, AVAX staking presents an opportunity to support the network while earning rewards.
