# Avalanche

## Avalanche: A Revolutionary Consensus Protocol
Avalanche is an innovative open-source platform designed for launching decentralized finance applications and enterprise blockchain deployments within a single, highly scalable ecosystem. Developers leveraging Avalanche’s capabilities can effortlessly craft robust, secure applications and tailor-made blockchain networks. This platform empowers them to construct intricate rulesets or build atop existing private or public subnets, ultimately driving the creation of reliable and impactful solutions.

## AVAX Staking on Dappnode: Earn Rewards while supporting Avalanche Network

:::info
A guide to running an Avalanche validator node on Dappnode is coming soon. In the meantime, you can find more information on the [Avalanche website](https://www.avalabs.org/).
:::

By running an Avalanche node on Dappnode, you actively participate in the decentralization of the network. Through this engagement, you contribute to the security and reliability of Avalanche’s consensus model.

Engage in AVAX staking to contribute to the security and decentralization of the Avalanche network. Stake your AVAX tokens to become a delegator or validator, and in return, earn rewards for your participation in the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. With a minimum of 2000 AVAX tokens required to start a validator, AVAX staking presents an opportunity to support the network while earning rewards.
