# Ethereum Rollups: An Overview

Rollups are advanced layer-2 scaling solutions designed to increase the throughput of the Ethereum network. By executing and storing transaction data off the main Ethereum chain while keeping a cryptographic commitment on-chain, Rollups enhance scalability and reduce fees. Rollups can be broadly categorized into two types: Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, each with its unique approach and trade-offs.

Currently, we support:

- [**:four_leaf_clover: Optimism**](/docs/user/rollups/optimism): An optimistic Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, enhancing speed and efficiency.

## Enable rollups

To enable this feature, you need to switch on the rollups module in the top bar of the Dappnode UI (Dappmanager):
