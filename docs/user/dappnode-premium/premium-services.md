## Advanced push notifications
### Push notifications
All Dappnode users have **complete access to the whole set of notifications** in the Dappmanager or in the app for free. The advantage of being a Premium user is to **receive push notifications in mobile and desktop**.

Dappnode users can activate their preferred notifications and manage the subscribed devices in the Dappmanager's Notification section.

### Validator notifications
In addition to the current [list of notifications](https://docs.dappnode.io/docs/user/notifications/notifications-list) (System, DMS, Execution and Consensus clients and Direct notifications), the following free **validator notifications** have been added recently:

- **Validator online**. Sent if your validator(s) is attesting.
- **Validator offline**. Sent you if your validator(s) missed an attestation. 
- **Validator slashed**. Sent if your validator(s) was slashed.
- **Missed block proposal** Sent if you missed a proposal.
- **Submitted block proposal** Sent if you proposed a block.

The notifications are sent 6,4 min after the attestation happens based on the justified epoch data. 

More notifications will be added to the current set gradually to provide a more complete monitoring experience. 

## Beacon Node Backup

The Beacon Node Backup ensures that **all imported validators in your Dappnode remain active** when attestation issues arise. 

The backup runs for **7 days** once it is activated manually by the user in the Premium interface. This time allows users to fix their staking issues safely and return to normal operation. The backup can be used once a month for 7 days. If the user decides to deactivate the backup before the 7 days, the time remaining can't be used later.  

Currently the backup is available in Ethereum. It has a **limit of 10 Ethereum validators per user**. If you exceed this number, we invite you to consolidate your validators to use the service.

The backup service connects to the user's consensus client via an API key. **Validator keys are not managed by Dappnode** in the backup process. The users always retains full control of their keys.

The service is currently **available only for Ethereum**. More chains will be added soon.
