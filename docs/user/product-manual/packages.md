# Packages View

On this view, we can check what packages we have installed in our DAppNodes. You can check some general parameters and do the next actions on this page:

- **STATUS**: indicate the state of the package, they can be 3: Running, Crashed and Stopped. Running mean is turned on. Crashed means the package has suffered some error and it's stopped. Stopped means the container has been stopped by the user.
- **Name**: it's the name of the package.
- **Link to de package view**: click on it to go to the package view in case you want to check some parameter or set up something related to the package.
- **Restart package**: restart all the package, it means all the containers of the package are restarted.
