# VPN view

This page can be a bit different depending on how you have installed DAppNode or what packages are installed.

There are 2 tabs:

- OpenVpn
- Wireguard

## OpenVpn

OpenVPN is installed by default. You will see the next image.

<p align="center">

</p>

The options are:

- **Credentials**: Get linkutdated and it does not matter now.
- **Reset**: Remove and create new credentials for OpenVPN.
- **Remove**: Remove the configurations of the device you select.

<!-- You have a full guide about how to set up OpenVPN and the OpenVPN client [here](./recommended-set-ups/add-vpn-devices). -->

## Wireguard

### Wireguard is not installed

In this case, wireguard is not installed in your DAppNode. You can do it by clicking on the link that appears.
