# Gnosis Chain

**Gnosis Chain** stands as a sentinel, functioning as a canary chain for Ethereum. It's operated and nurtured by the vibrant **GnosisDAO community**. With over 10% of its validators being home stakers via Dappnode, it's a testament to its popularity and accessibility.

## Joining the Gnosis Chain as a Validator

Staking on the Gnosis Chain is both easy and economical. All it takes is a mere **1 GNO** to kickstart your journey as a Gnosis Chain validator. This low barrier to entry ensures that anyone, regardless of their financial position, can participate actively in the network.

## Finding Your Way in Dappnode

Venture into the **Stakers Menu**, and under the **Gnosis Chain** tab, you'll discover:

- **Execution Clients**:
  - Nethermind Xdai (Available now)
  - Erigon (Coming soon!)

- **Consensus Clients**:
  - Lighthouse
  - Teku
  - Lodestar

### Smooth Sailing Setup

1. **Client Selection**: The user-friendly interface makes choosing Nethermind Xdai and a consensus client a breeze.
2. **Sync Optimization**: Activate checksync during consensus client selection. This initiates a synced checkpoint, reducing synchronization time considerably by syncing backwards.
3. **Nethermind Xdai Syncing**: Post consensus client sync, Nethermind Xdai will embark on its syncing journey. This process might span a few hours. Stay patient and monitor the progress. For clarity, always refer to Nethermind's logs.

**Note**: Similar to Ethereum's mainnet, opting to run one or multiple validators necessitates the **Web3Signer Gnosis** tool.
