The Lukso blockchain is a new, EVM-compatible L1 that fully supports the ERC-725 standard for universal profiles (UPs). Its uses have different applications in the creative industries. Being compatible with Ethereum, Lukso also uses the same clients for its nodes:
- 1 execution client (Geth and Erigon for Lukso available)
- 1 consensus client (Prysm and Lighthouse for Lukso available)
