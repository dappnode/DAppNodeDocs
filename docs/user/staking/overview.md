## What is Staking?
Staking is the act of allocating a portion of your cryptocurrency holdings as collateral to participate in:
1. **Validating Blocks:** Confirming transaction records and adding them to the blockchain.
2. **Securing the Chain:** Ensuring the network remains resistant to malicious intentions.
3. **Earning Rewards:** As a validator, you get paid for your services in the form of more cryptocurrency.
