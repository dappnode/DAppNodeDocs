# Goerli Testnet

The **Goerli testnet** reigns as the preeminent testnet for the Ethereum ecosystem, serving as a sandbox for users and developers alike. 

Dappnode paves an easy pathway for enthusiasts to operate a node on the Goerli testnet, ensuring practical experience without the risks associated with the mainnet.

## Navigating to Goerli in Dappnode

You can locate the Goerli testnet under the **Prater** tab in the **Stakers Menu**. This intuitive design ensures that even novices can seamlessly set up their testnet node.

## Why Run a Goerli Testnet Node?

1. **Hands-on Experience**: Running a validator on the Goerli testnet offers invaluable practical knowledge. It mimics the mainnet processes, providing a comprehensive understanding of node operation.
2. **Risk-free Exploration**: As it's a testnet, you're not staking real ETH. This provides an opportunity for experimentation without the financial stakes of the main Ethereum network.

**Tip**: If you're new to Ethereum or wish to familiarize yourself with node operation intricacies, starting with the Goerli testnet is highly recommended. It's the perfect platform for hands-on learning in a risk-free environment.
