# Notifications

Ethical Metrics provides you with a range of notifications to keep you informed about the status and performance of your dappnode. These notifications are designed to help you proactively address any potential issues. Currently, the following notifications are available:

1. **Dappnode Down Notification:** When your dappnode goes offline and is unable to send its metrics to our monitoring servers for an entire hour, you'll receive this notification.

2. **Dappnode CPU Over 80% for 15 Minutes:** If your dappnode's CPU usage surpasses 80% for a continuous duration of 15 minutes, Ethical Metrics will send you a notification. This alert helps you identify instances where your dappnode's resources are nearing capacity.

3. **Dappnode CPU Over 90% for 5 Minutes:** If your dappnode's CPU usage spikes above 90% and maintains this level for 5 consecutive minutes, you'll receive a notification. This alert enables you to respond promptly to high CPU utilization scenarios.

We're committed to enhancing your monitoring experience, and we're continuously working to improve Ethical Metrics. In the future, we plan to introduce additional notifications to provide you with even more insights into your dappnode's health and performance.
