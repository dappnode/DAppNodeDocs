## 2. Secure Your Recovery Token

Upon successful registration, you'll be provided with a Recovery Token. This token is crucial for:

- Retrieving your password if forgotten.
- Regaining account access if needed.

  **To safeguard your token**:

- Click the button or link labeled "View Recovery Token".
- Diligently copy the token and store it in a safe location.

:::caution
We recommend that you store your token in both digital (encrypted) and physical forms (noted and stored securely). If you lose access to both your password and token, you will lose access to your account.
