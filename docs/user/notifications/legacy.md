# Notifications Legacy

In the legacy section you have access to the previous system of notifications with email and telegram. The aim of the new notification system is to unify the notifications in a single channel in desktop and mobile to facilitate the user experience and be more reliable, configurable and scalable. Therefore, this section will be deprecated in the upcoming core releases.

### The Notification system will evolve continuously
We hope the new notification system will help you to have a 360º tracking of your Dappnode and staking activity. New notifications will be added to improve your monitoring continuously.

If you have feedback to improve the new notifications, let us know all your ideas in Discord.
