# üì£ Notification system

## 1. Overview

Dappnode Notifications is a built-in system that keeps you informed about important events and updates across your Dappnode setup. Whether it's a new software release, a hardware warning, or a consensus sync alert ‚Äî notifications are your go-to source for staying up to date.

Notifications are package-based, meaning each package can send its own alerts. To receive notifications, you have the Notifications package installed by default and running on your Dappnode.

### Benefits

### üñ•Ô∏è Monitor Your Hardware and System in one channel

Get real-time alerts about your system health: CPU load, disk space, temperature, and more. 
It‚Äôs like having all the information about your Dappnode and staking setup in one place running 24/7.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customization for Every Package

You can fine-tune notification settings per package, including the thresholds that triggers different alerts in the package.  

### üì¨ Direct communication from the Dappnode Team

Receive **direct messages** from the Dappnode team for critical network events like chain forks or urgent updates (e.g. the Pectra fork). This aims to stay ahead and take action before it‚Äôs too late.

### How to Access Notifications

### üîî Bell Icon

In the new notification tab you can find three sections: Inbox, Settings and Legacy.

### üì® Inbox

In the inbox section, you will see new notifications and the complete history.
To understand how notifications work, there are several key characteristic to consider:

- **New notification**: Unread notification that will show at the top of the history.
- **History**:  Notifications seen previously
- **Priority**: Importance level of the notification: Informational, Relevant, Important and Critical
    - **Informational** ‚Äì Awareness only; no action is needed.
    - **Relevant** ‚Äì Action is recommended but not urgent.
    - **Important** ‚Äì Prompt action is strongly advised.
    - **Critical** ‚Äì Immediate action is required.
- **Status**:  Two notification status: `Triggered` when the notification is active and it is sent, and `Resolved` when the event notified is back to normal.
- **Category**: There are different notifications categories: Hardware, System, Ethereum, Lukso, Gnosis and Hoodi. You can filter the notifications by category.
- **Banner**: It is shown at the top of the UI for urgent notices.
- **Filter:** You can filter notifications in the search bar by Package name (`DnpName`) Title and keywords.

### Legacy

In the legacy section you have access to the previous system of notifications with email and telegram. The aim of the new notification system is to unify the notifications in a single channel in desktop and mobile to facilitate the user experience and be more reliable, configurable and scalable. Therefore, this section will be deprecated in the upcoming core releases.
