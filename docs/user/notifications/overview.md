# Notifications Overview

Dappnode Notifications is a built-in system that keeps you informed about important events and updates across your Dappnode setup. Whether it's a new software release, a hardware warning, or a consensus sync alert — notifications are your go-to source for staying up to date.

Notifications are package-based, meaning each package can send its own alerts. To receive notifications, you have the Notifications package installed by default and running on your Dappnode.

### Benefits

### 🖥️ Monitor Your Hardware and System in one channel

Get real-time alerts about your system health: CPU load, disk space, temperature, and more. 
It’s like having all the information about your Dappnode and staking setup in one place running 24/7.

### ⚙️ Customization for Every Package

You can fine-tune notification settings per package, including the thresholds that triggers different alerts in the package.  

### 📬 Direct communication from the Dappnode Team

Receive **direct messages** from the Dappnode team for critical network events like chain forks or urgent updates (e.g. the Pectra fork). This aims to stay ahead and take action before it’s too late.

### How to Access Notifications

### 🔔 Bell Icon

Find the **bell icon** at the top right corner of your Dappmanager. Click it to view new or past notifications. The bell icon will show a blue dot when new notifications are triggered.

### 📚 Side Menu

You’ll also find a dedicated **Notifications** section in the side menu.
