## 🌐 1.2 Accessing the Dappnode User Interface or Dashboard

The most common way to interact with your dappnode is through a web browser in another computer. This means that Dappnode works as a server, and doesn't have a traditional graphic interface as regular personal computers do, so if you're sitting in front of a login prompt wondering what's next you're doing great so far!
