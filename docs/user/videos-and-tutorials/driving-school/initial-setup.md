Welcome to Dappnode Driving School! Here you'll find a series of videos that will guide you through the initial setup process. From booting Dappnode from ISO and accessing it through VPN, to setting up your Ethereum node, we've got you covered.

## 🖥️ 1.1 Booting from the Dappnode ISO

## 🌐 1.2 Accessing the Dappnode User Interface or Dashboard

The most common way to interact with your dappnode is through a web browser in another computer. This means that Dappnode works as a server, and doesn't have a traditional graphic interface as regular personal computers do, so if you're sitting in front of a login prompt wondering what's next you're doing great so far!
