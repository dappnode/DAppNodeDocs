We recommend going through **[Initial Setup](/docs/user/videos-and-tutorials/driving-school/initial-setup.md)** of Dappnode Driving School before watching these videos, as these videos expect you to have a basic understanding of how your Dappnode works and how to access it.

Once you have your Dappnode up and running, you can start configuring it to suit your needs. Here are some videos to help you with that:
