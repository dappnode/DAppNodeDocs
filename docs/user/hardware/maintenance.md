## Maintenance

This section will cover four different approaches to servicing your hardware. The order is by level of difficulty from easiest to hardest. Remember that if you have any questions they're always welcome in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dappnode).

### 1. Air Flow
One of the key elements to keep your Dappnode's performance optimal is where you place it. There's this myth about air conditioning or cool air being able to lower your devices' temperatures, however constant **air flow** is much more important than the temperature of the air itself. We recommend picking a place for your Dappnode that will favor this, and where the heat it produces won't stay in the same room and raise the atmosphere temperature. An open room with windows is great for this, so you should about closets or small storage rooms. If your Dappnode is still struggling to keep its temperature low, try removing the upper lid. It won't look as pretty, but it'll get the job done!

### 2. Dust clean
You've probably seen one of these in the past:

These cans are very helpful to get your Dappnode's insides clean. You can do this by carefully oppening the bottom metal lid. Loosen its four screws and be specially careful when lifting it, as there's a SATA ribbon cable attached to the NUC's board and the metal lid that can be damaged if handled roughly. 

For diving into the actual cleaning of your Dappnode, try to be in an outside location when performing this dust cleaning process. Keep your Dappnode safe from humidity or extreme direct temperatures. Carefuly place the can of duster in a vertical position for starting the cleaning process. Always point the airstream somewhere other than your device when starting to use it, as these release liquid for a brief period of time sometimes. After you've made sure the duster is working as expected, start blowing at the smaller spaces in the board and gradually moving to the more general area of your hardware without getting the tip of the duster to close to the circuits. Make sure the fans don't have big chunks of dust that prevent them from working properly.

When done, put the bottom metal lid back on and screw it back without leaving it too tight.

## 3. Different Case
If your climate conditions prove to be challenging for your Dappnode, 

## 4. Thermal Paste Change
Your CPU has a heatsink right above it that helps it dissipate the heat off it. In order to make this temperature transfer your CPU uses a thermal paste between its top plate and the heatsink.
