# Hardware

In this section you will find information related to the hardware of the Dappnode's host machine. If you had noticed any issue with it and have tried some steps provided by the Dappnode community and/or staff without success, this section of the Dappnode documentation will help you solving those that are on the hardware side of things.

Here are some topics you can check:

- [**🛠️ Maintenance**](/docs/user/hardware/maintenance): Some approaches that may be helpful for your dappnode to perform as expected.

- [**🌡️ Temperature**](/docs/user/hardware/temperature): Instructions for keeping track of your dappnode's temperature.
