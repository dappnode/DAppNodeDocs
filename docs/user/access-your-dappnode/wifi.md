# Wi-Fi Access to Dappnode

If you bought a Dappnode from our store, or installed Dappnode on a computer with a built-in Wi-Fi chip, you can easily connect to the **Dappmanager** (Dappnode web UI) using the Dappnode's Wi-Fi hotspot.

For those who got their hardware elsewhere, there's a chance the Wi-Fi card might not be recognized by the operating system. If this happens, you might need to install the required firmware. Since the steps vary based on the hardware, please contact our support on Discord if you face any issues.

## Connecting to Dappnode Wi-Fi

1. 📱 On a device of your choice, navigate to the **Wi-Fi settings**.
2. 🔍 Search and select the network labeled as `DappnodeWIFI`.
3. 🔑 Enter the password: `dappnode`.
4. 🌐 Open a browser and go to http://my.dappnode/.

:::caution
After connecting for the first time, go to the Wi-Fi section in the left menu of **Dappmanager** and change the hotspot password to something only you know.

## Wi-Fi Settings in Dappmanager

Once in the Wi-Fi section, you'll find two main options:

1. **Toggle Wi-Fi**: Here, you can turn the Wi-Fi feature on or off.
2. **Wi-Fi Credentials**: Set a new network name (SSID) and password for your Dappnode's Wi-Fi. We strongly advise you to change the default settings for better security.
