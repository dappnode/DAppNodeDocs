# Unsubscribing from Smooth.

Unsubscribing from Smooth is as simple as subscribing to it. You can unsubscribe from Smooth at any time, it is done through **[Smooth's website](https://smooth.dappnode.io/)** and it only takes one simple transaction.

:::caution
When unsubscribing a validator from Smooth, you will lose all pending rewards attached to it. We recommend unsubscribing just after successfully proposing a block, so lost pending rewards are minimized.
:::

## Step 1: Log in to Smooth's website.

Go to [Smooth's website](https://smooth.dappnode.io/) and log in with your wallet. A list of all the validators with the same withdrawal address as your logged in wallet will appear.

## Step 2: Click on the "Unsubscribe" button of the validator you want to unsubscribe.

Once logged in, click on the "Unsubscribe" button of the validator you want to unsubscribe from Smooth.

</p>

Once clicking on the "Unsubscribe" button, a dialog will appear warning you that you are about to unsubscribe from Smooth, and that it is recommended to do it when pending rewards are low. Click on <em>"Claim my rewards"</em> to continue and follow the dialog instructions. If you have any claimable rewards, a transaction that claims them will be prepared. If no claimable rewards are available, you will jump directly into the unsubscribe transaction.

Once the subscription transaction is processed by the chain, your validator will have been unsubscribed sucessfully from Smooth. You can check it by reloading your validator's table.

:::caution
After unsubscribing, we recommend to change your validator's fee recipient back to another address as soon as possible, in order to avoid automatically subscribing to Smooth again.
