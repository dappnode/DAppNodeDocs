# Unsubscribing from Smooth.

Unsubscribing from [Smooth](https://smooth.dappnode.io/) is as simple as subscribing to it. You can unsubscribe from [Smooth](https://smooth.dappnode.io/) at any time, it is done through **[Smooth's website](https://smooth.dappnode.io/)** and it only takes one simple transaction.

:::caution
When unsubscribing a validator from [Smooth](https://smooth.dappnode.io/), you will lose all pending rewards attached to it. We recommend unsubscribing just after successfully proposing a block, so lost pending rewards are minimized.

Once clicking on the "Unsubscribe" button, a dialog will appear warning you that you are about to unsubscribe from [Smooth](https://smooth.dappnode.io/), and that it is recommended to do it when pending rewards are low. Click on <em>"Claim my rewards"</em> to continue and follow the dialog instructions. If you have any claimable rewards, a transaction that claims them will be prepared. If no claimable rewards are available, you will jump directly into the unsubscribe transaction.

Once the subscription transaction is processed by the chain, your validator will have been unsubscribed sucessfully from [Smooth](https://smooth.dappnode.io/). You can check it by reloading your validator's table.

:::caution
After unsubscribing, we recommend to change your validator's fee recipient back to another address as soon as possible, in order to avoid automatically subscribing to [Smooth](https://smooth.dappnode.io/)https://smooth.dappnode.io/ again.
