# Consolidations

Since the [Pectra](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#pectra) update on May 7, 2025, validators can stake up to 2048 ETH. Instead of having to manage multiple 32 ETH validators, users can now choose to stake an arbitrary amount of ETH in a single validator. 

To make a validator able to stake more than 32 ETH, users  will have to **Upgrade the validator's withdrawal credentials**: From 0x01 to 0x02.

It is also possible to **Consolidate** multiple 32 ETH validators into a single validator with a higher stake. This requires an extra step: a **consolidation**. 

In a consolidation, two validators are merged into a single one. The "source" validator will exit the chain, transferring its stake to the "target" validator. 

Both these steps can be done through the [Staking Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/) interface.

## How Smooth manages consolidations

Since the "source" validator will exit the chain, it will not be able to propose blocks anymore and therefore convert its smooth's pending rewards into accumulated rewards. Effectively losing them.

To avoid this, Smooth will automatically detect when a validator is the "source" of a consolidation. Upon doing so, it will transfer all the "pending rewards" from the source validator to the target validator. This way, the user will not lose any pending rewards during the consolidation process. Smooth will also remove the source validator from the pool.

## As a Smooth user, what do I need to do?

We recommend upgrading your validatorâ€™s withdrawal credentials to 0x02 and perform the consolidation through the [Staking Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/) interface. You will not need to do anything else, Smooth will take care of everything else.

A consolidation may take a few days to complete. Only once your "source" validator exits the chain, Smooth will transfer the pending rewards to the target validator. We recommend checking [Smooth's dashboard](https://smooth.dappnode.io/dashboard) to see if the transfer was successful.

:::danger
DO NOT manually unsubscribe any validator before signing the consolidation. Unsubscribing a validator will remove its pending rewards and Smooth will not be able to transfer them to the target validator.
