# Automatic Subscription

### Step 1: Change your fee recipient to Smooth's address.

The simplest way to subscribe to Smooth is to do it automatically when giving your next proposed block rewards to Smooth. This can be done easily by just changing the fee recipient of your validator to Smooth's address. In dappnode, this process is as simple as changing the fee recipient in your [staking brain](http://brain.web3signer.dappnode/). Once Smooth recieves the rewards from your validator, it will automatically subscribe your validator to Smooth, and you will start receiving rewards from other members of Smooth!

:::caution Keep the fee recipient set to Smooth's address!
It is extremely important that you keep the fee recipient of your validator set to Smooth's address (`0xAdFb8D27671F14f297eE94135e266aAFf8752e35`). If, at any point, you change the fee recipient of your validator and propose a block without unsubscribing from Smooth first, you will be banned from Smooth and will not be able to participate in it again.
